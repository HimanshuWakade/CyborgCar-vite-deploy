# React Props(Properties/attributes)
- React Props (properties) facilitate data transfer from parent to child components.
- Data flows unidirectionally, ensuring a clear direction of information in React Applications.
- Props Are immutable, Meaning child components cannot modify the data received from parents.
- Child components access props through their function parameters.
- You can also pass JSX as props to another component.
